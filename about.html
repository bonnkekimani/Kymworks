        <h1>About Us Page</h1>
        <p> "Hello! My name is Bonnke Kimani (AKA Kym) from Nairobi Kenya.</p>
        <p> 
            As a born and raised New Yorker, I take food quite seriously. 
            In fact, I based my entire graphic design career around it! 
            I have worked for a variety of restaurants and franchises to 
            create logos, brochures, websites, menus, product labels and 
            countless other deliverables.
            As someone who also completed culinary school, I can 
            promise you I know what good food looks like.
            As someone who has a graphic design background, I 
            can also promise you that I know how to market it.
            My interests outside of graphic design and food culture 
            include listening to classical music, writing poetry and riding my road bike. 
            I am eager to work with up-and-coming food brands, although I 
            certainly enjoy designing for well-established companies too.

                <h2>What keeps me running</h2>
                “No matter how much experience you have, how many degrees you have,<br>
                or how well-known you have become — there is always something new to learn. <br>
                Don’t rest on your past experiences. If you do nothing to improve <br>
                your skills, you won’t stay where you are.” <br>
